## Introduction

wsg? I'm Iyaad, a sort of nextjs enthusiast with a passion creating everyday applications ig. Yk, regular small apps for random side projects...

## What I'm Up To (sort of)

- **School**: studying alot ig 🤷‍♂️

## Support My Work

If you like what I do and want to support my journey, you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/iyaad_arshad). I don't really need donations, but if you feel like it ig?

## Crypto wallets
apparently people put their wallets on their public profile?
but it's not optimal to change my username like that, so like i'm just going to leave it here
